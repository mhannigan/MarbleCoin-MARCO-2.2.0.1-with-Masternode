UNIX BUILD NOTES
================

Dependencies
---------------------

These dependencies are required:

 Library     | Purpose          | Description
 ------------|------------------|----------------------
 libssl      | Crypto           | Random Number Generation
 libgmp      | Secp256k1        | Secp256k1 Dependency
 libboost    | Utility          | Library for threading, data structures, etc
 libevent    | Networking       | OS independent asynchronous networking
 libdb4.8    | Berkeley DB      | Wallet storage (only needed when wallet enabled)
 libsecp256k1| Secp256k1        | Elliptic Curve Cryptography

Optional dependencies:

 Library     | Purpose          | Description
 ------------|------------------|----------------------
 miniupnpc   | UPnP Support     | Firewall-jumping support
 qt          | GUI              | GUI toolkit (only needed when GUI enabled)
 protobuf    | Payments in GUI  | Data interchange format used for payment protocol (only needed when GUI enabled)
 libqrencode | QR codes in GUI  | Optional for generating QR codes (only needed when GUI enabled)

For the versions used in the release, see [release-process.md](release-process.md) under *Fetch and build inputs*.

System requirements
--------------------

C++ compilers are memory-hungry. It is recommended to have at least 1 GB of
memory available when compiling LindaCoin Core. With 512MB of memory or less
compilation will take much longer due to swap thrashing.

Dependency Build Instructions: Ubuntu & Debian
----------------------------------------------
Build requirements:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential libtool automake autotools-dev autoconf pkg-config libssl-dev libgmp3-dev libevent-dev bsdmainutils

On at least Ubuntu 14.04+ and Debian 7+ there are generic names for the
individual boost development packages, so the following can be used to only
install necessary parts of boost:

    sudo apt-get install libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-chrono-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-test-dev libboost-thread-dev

If that doesn't work, you can install all boost development packages with:

    sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev

BerkeleyDB is required for the wallet. db4.8 packages are available [here](https://launchpad.net/~bitcoin/+archive/bitcoin).
You can add the repository and install using the following commands:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev
    
If that does not work alternatively download and compile: 
    
    cd ~
    mkdir bitcoin/db4/
    
    wget 'http://download.oracle.com/berkeley-db/db-4.8.30.NC.tar.gz'
    tar -xzvf db-4.8.30.NC.tar.gz
    cd db-4.8.30.NC/build_unix/
    ../dist/configure --enable-cxx
    make
    sudo make install

 
Ubuntu and Debian have their own libdb-dev and libdb++-dev packages, but these will install
BerkeleyDB 5.1 or later, which break binary wallet compatibility with the distributed executables which
are based on BerkeleyDB 4.8. If you do not care about wallet compatibility,
pass `--with-incompatible-bdb` to configure.

To build Secp256k1:

    cd src/secp256k1/ && ./configure && make
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig

Optional:

    sudo apt-get install libminiupnpc-dev (see --with-miniupnpc and --enable-upnp-default)

Dependencies for the GUI: Ubuntu & Debian
-----------------------------------------

If you want to build Linda-Qt, make sure that the required packages for Qt development
are installed. Qt 5 is necessary to build the GUI.
If both Qt 4 and Qt 5 are installed, Qt 5 will be used.

To build with Qt 5 (recommended) you need the following:

    sudo apt-get install libqt5gui5 libqt5core5a libqt5dbus5 qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler

libqrencode (optional) can be installed with:

    sudo apt-get install libqrencode-dev

Once these are installed, they will be found by configure and a Linda-qt executable will be
built by default.

```

Notes
-----
1) You only need Berkeley DB if the wallet is enabled (see the section *Disable-Wallet mode* below).

2) The release is built with GCC and then "strip transferd" to strip the debug
symbols, which reduces the executable size by about 90%.

If you get an error about secp256k1
cd secp256k1/
./autogen.sh
./configure.sh
make
cd ..
make -f makefile.unix
strip Lindad

To Build Lindad
--------

With UPNP:

    cd src && \
    make -f makefile.unix && \
    strip Lindad

(Recommended) Without UPNP:

    cd src && \
    make -f makefile.unix USE_UPNP= && \
    strip Lindad

To Build Linda-QT
--------

With UPNP:
    qmake -qt=qt5 && \
    make \

(Recommended) Without UPNP:

    qmake -qt=qt5 USE_UPNP=- && \
    make \
